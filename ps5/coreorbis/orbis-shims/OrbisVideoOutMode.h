// PS5SX2 (2.11, AI-assisted): switching the console's VideoOut to its 119.88 Hz output from the app, for frame generation.
// Copyright (C) 2026 swordpdf

//
// Frame generation shows a 60 fps game at 120 (a generated frame before each of the game's) and a PAL game at 50 as 100. That needs
// the console's output at 119.88 Hz. The 2.02 build had it from its driver (ps5vk's "high frame rate" output, selector 15 of
// sceVideoOutConfigureOutput, from the public ps5-opengl runtime and Mihawk-99's PS5_Vulkan); the drivers 2.03 and later were linked
// with have no output code, so the display stayed at 59.94 Hz and only games at 30 fps or less got generated frames. This is the
// app-side way, used ONLY when frame generation is on, the driver exports no output control of its own (ps5vk_output_*), and the
// switch file fg120 is there (flags/fg120; flags/nofg120 turns it off for good): it makes the driver's sequence by hand, then
// leaves the output at 120 Hz for the driver's own VideoOut handle. NOT TESTED ON A CONSOLE.
//
// The sequence, as the driver author measured it on a console (PS5_Vulkan docs/HARDWARE_FINDINGS.md, M5_PHASE_C.md):
//   - sceVideoOutOpen on a fresh handle (user 0xff, bus 0, index 0), before any flip rate or buffer is set
//   - sceVideoOutIsOutputSupported(15) must answer > 0; at 1080p console output it answered 0 and ConfigureOutput returned
//     0x80290019; a title that doesn't declare high frame rates (param.json attribute3 0x80040) gets 0x80290016. Anything but a
//     positive answer: nothing is configured.
//   - sceVideoOutConfigureOutput(15) must return 0, and then the vblank period is TIMED: an accepted mode once kept refreshing at
//     60 Hz. The median of 6 intervals between bare sceVideoOutWaitVblank calls (the first call finding the phase) has to be under
//     12.5 ms (8.34 ms at 119.88 Hz, 16.68 at 59.94); if it is not, or a wait fails, selector 1 puts the default output back.
//   - an output at 120 Hz outlives the process that asked for it, so it is put back (selector 1) before the process ends.
// Then the handle is closed WITHOUT restoring, and 5 s pass before the driver opens VideoOut again: the 2.02 driver would not open
// it sooner than 5,000,000,000 ns after a 120 Hz output closed (its constant, read from the disassembly), because an open right
// after the close failed. The drivers 2.03 and later have no such guard and only two retries 500 ms apart. The caller runs
// SelectHighFrameRate on a thread of its own while the VM boots, so the 5 s are mostly overlapped.
//
// A marker file (logs/output-120.txt) is written before the output is configured and removed when it is restored: a start that finds
// it (the app was killed, a crash, the console's menu) restores the default output first, and does not switch in that run.
//
// Pure logic over a table of calls (Ops), so a PC test runs it with a fake VideoOut and clock (tests/videoout);
// OrbisVideoOutMode.cpp has the real calls, the thread and the marker file.
