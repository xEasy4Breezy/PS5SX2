// PS5SX2 (2.11, AI-assisted): when the app honours the disc helper's "exec" signal (logs/disc-launch-exec.txt) and when it does not, kept apart from the
// PS5 calls so a PC test can run every case.
//
// Testers (via swordpdf): "after the game is dumped it wants to start, but the disc stops spinning, the PS5 recognizes there is a disc inside and
// aborts, and jumps back to the XMB instead". No log has the end of a copy, so the cause is not proven. What the code does at the end of a copy
// when the disc was put in while PS5SX2 was open is two starts: the watcher (ProsperoDiscDump.cpp) starts the game in this process at once, and about
// a second later the disc helper (the payload that runs beside the app) sees the finished copy too and asks the app, with logs/disc-launch-exec.txt,
// to re-execute its own eboot to come to the front. The watcher answered that with sceSystemServiceLoadExec about 3 s later: in the middle of the
// shelf's shut-down or the game's start, killing the game that was starting. The signal is still the only thing that starts a PS2 CD or a USB DVD
// the helper copied itself (the app never sees those discs), and it still serves the idle shelf, so it is not simply dropped: it is honoured unless a
// game is already being started or runs in this process (nothing to bring to the front: the helper's focus kick does that), or this process is a
// disc tile (a copy of the app under another title ID, where an exec of PPSA99203's eboot is the cross-title exec that ends at the home screen).
// Flag discexec: the old behaviour (every signal honoured, except in a tile). Flag nodiscexec: every signal ignored (for a test round).
